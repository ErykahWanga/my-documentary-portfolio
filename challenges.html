            <h3>Access to Remote Locations</h3>
            <p>One of the biggest challenges I've faced as a documentary photographer is gaining access to remote and restricted locations. Many of the subjects I photograph live in areas that are hard to reach, either due to geographical limitations, political barriers, or safety concerns. Despite these obstacles, I've learned to adapt, plan, and work closely with local guides and organizations to document these stories.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="challenge">
            <h3>Emotional Impact of the Work</h3>
            <p>Documenting human suffering, conflict, and displacement can take an emotional toll. Seeing the hardships people endure firsthand can be overwhelming. I’ve had to find ways to cope with the emotional impact of the work while maintaining a level of objectivity in my photography. It’s important to me to preserve the dignity of the subjects while also staying emotionally connected to their stories.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="challenge">
            <h3>Ethical Dilemmas</h3>
            <p>There are times when ethical dilemmas arise in documentary photography, especially when documenting sensitive subjects like trauma, poverty, or conflict. It can be difficult to strike a balance between showing the truth and respecting the privacy of those being photographed. I constantly reflect on the ethical implications of my work and strive to tell the most honest, respectful story possible.</p>

        <div class="challenge">
            <h3>Limited Resources in the Field</h3>
            <p>Working in the field often means dealing with limited resources, whether it’s the lack of electricity, backup equipment, or access to modern technology. Photographers working in challenging environments must often make do with what’s available, and this forces creativity in how to capture the story. Sometimes the limitations make for a more authentic representation of the situation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="challenge">
            <h3>Language Barriers</h3>
            <p>Many of the communities I photograph speak different languages, which can pose a challenge when trying to communicate effectively with subjects. I’ve often had to rely on translators and cultural intermediaries, which can sometimes create misunderstandings. Building rapport with subjects, despite language differences, has been one of the most important skills I've developed in my career.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="challenge">
            <h3>Political Sensitivities</h3>
            <p>Working in politically sensitive areas presents a significant challenge, particularly when documenting protest movements, governmental corruption, or armed conflict. In some cases, the subjects I photograph may be in danger if their identities are revealed, and this adds a layer of complexity to my work. I've had to become adept at working discreetly and maintaining confidentiality while also telling compelling, impactful stories.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="challenge">
            <h3>Maintaining Creative Vision Under Pressure</h3>
            <p>When working in challenging environments, it’s easy to get caught up in the logistics and safety concerns. However, I always strive to maintain my creative vision amidst the pressure. Balancing artistic integrity with the need to document events as they unfold requires flexibility and adaptability, but it’s one of the most rewarding aspects of my work.</p>
